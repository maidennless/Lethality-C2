**LETHALITY C2**
#  


This is a python based C2 server made as a class project. It has a command execution module, DDOS module (working on displaying it's output), Keylogger module and also supports payload generation.
The server runs on flask. The interface could be better but too lazy. Make sure to install the requirements before using it.



> Also note that, after starting the server, you need to open the web server to actually catch any bots.
